            <h2>An excerpt from Dracula</h2>

            <div>

                <p>I could not tell the others of the day's discovery till we were alone; so after dinner--followed by a little music to save appearances even amongst ourselves--I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed. The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me as though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and I came away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no difference between us.</p>

                <p>When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in the study. In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own information; when I had finished Van Helsing said:--</p>

                <p>This has been a great day's work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we are on the track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that house, then our work is near the end. But if there be some missing, we must search until we find them. Then shall we make our final coup, and hunt the wretch to his real death." We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr. Morris spoke:--</p>

                <p>Say! how are we going to get into that house?"</p>

                <p>We got into the other," answered Lord Godalming quickly.</p>

                <p>But, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax, but we had night and a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different thing to commit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night. I confess I don't see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key of some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the morning." Lord Godalming's brows contracted, and he stood up and walked about the room. By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to another of us:--</p>

            <h2>CSS Animation</h2>

            <div id="blogdiv">
            <p>A word about CSS Animations:</p>
            <p>Many resources were provided to us by our instructors for our journey to start out with web development. Few of them stuck out to me as much as a presentation by Vanessa Alvarez, an expert on animations who is passionate about them. Her presentation was mainly on “why?” animation might be chosen or not chosen for a given project. She starts off with the caveat that it shouldn’t be overused, an important pitfall of animation as a tool.</p>
            <p>What it is great for is that it breathes life, and with that, emotion, into an inanimate webpage (forgive the pun). It has the ability to start a “conversation” between page and user. With the help of animations, pages can “talk” to users by signaling, yes the page is loading, yes the information you have input is being sent. It also can let a user know, no the information you input was wrong/incompatible such as when filling out forms. It can also direct a user’s eyes to the important buttons on the page to deepen the relationship between a user and the page. Finally, they can simply set the mood of the page or brand of the page. Animations can be made to be sleek, cool, futuristic, snappy, slow, sleepy, calm, and everything in between. </p>
            <p>Ultimately, most animations are resource heavy and require the knowhow of advanced technologies and graphical design knowledge. However, one understated aspect of regular old CSS in basic webpages is that it too can be used to animate. As such, it is easy to use without any knowledge of JavaScript required. It is light on hardware resources trying to load a page and therefore quite reliable across many if not all devices, and to build upon that, because browsers handle all CSS rendering it lets browsers optimize for their performance and efficiency. </p>
            <p>Below is an animation built on just a tiny number of lines of code in a CSS stylesheet. </p>
