**Description**

Hi everyone. This is my first web develepment project, undertaken with the help of RVCC instructors and guidance. 

It is compromised of a few sections:
A navbar
A logo
Bit of info
My hobbies
Some photos I've taken
An embedded video
Some paragraphs of text
A small blog on CSS animation
A contact me form

**Color Scheme**

With the help of [adobe color picker](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) I was able to select colors that both contrast and complement. Major colors used:
 #DBCF3D
 #301B69
 #FFF9B9
